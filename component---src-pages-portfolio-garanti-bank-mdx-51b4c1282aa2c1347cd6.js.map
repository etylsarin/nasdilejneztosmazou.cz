The CSS was designed to work with all CMS output and for a potential lack of JavaScript support while the semantic HTML optimised all the content for SEO. Command-line tools and base64 encoding were also used for performance optimization including compression of JS, CSS & Images.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`My work on this project`}</h2>\n    <p>{`As a part of LBi London I was responsible for all HTML templates and majority of CSS as well as organization of structure for both. I was one of a two-man team who produced the whole of the front-end for the project.
